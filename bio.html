								After studying respectively design and political science (Sciences Po), Fred Raillard and Farid Mokart started as strategic planner and account manager in Paris. They decided to team up and moved to the creative side, working consecutively for 6 major agencies in Paris. They were the two youngest creative directors in France, leading the international accounts of CLM/BBDO Paris. Their first digital hit was for start-up Aucland.com, the French eBay, inviting TV viewers to discover the end of the spot on the Internet. They soon became worldwide creative directors of Pepsi International (ROW). In 2000, Fred & Farid created the highly viral and controversial musical video of British Pop Star Robbie Williams “Rock DJ” which won the Brit Awards, and an MTV award in the USA.
								<br/><br/>
Shots Magazine (Shots 61) chose the French team to start their gallery of the 12 best creative teams in the world (November 2000).
<br/><br/>
Then they embarked on an international career. At that time, Fred & Farid were the first major French creative team to move abroad and work outside France. In 2001, advertising legend Sir John Hegarty hired them at the prestigious BBH London to lead the biggest Microsoft launch: XBOX (500 million dollars).

							<p>
								“Fred & Farid have a huge talent. They know how to develop a narrative structure from an audacious idea” John Hegarty / Stratégies (08 February 2002).
 								<br/><br/>
Their Gold Lion viral spot XBOX Champagne found itself “Grand Prix finalist ”in Cannes in 2002, facing Nike Play. “This is one of the best spots I’ve seen all year. Everything about it is great. It should win the Palm” David Lubars / Shots (06 June 2002).
<br/><br/>
Fred & Farid became “Le tout Soho’s favourite Gallic creative team” Shots (14 August 2002).
<br/><br/>
“In just 18 months at BBH, Fred & Farid bagged a host of awards and a reputation as the team to watch in British Advertising” Creative Review (November 2002).
<br/><br/>
The French business magazine Strategies nicknamed them “The two Zidanes of the French advertising creation” Strategies (27 September 2002).
<br/><br/>
In his 2002 novel “L’Egoiste romantique”, famous French writer Frederic Beigbeder mentioned them as “Fred & Farid, the world’s best advertising creative”.
<br/><br/>
In 2002, the American advertising star Jeff Goodby hired them at digital agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco where they launched Netflix in USA and UK, and re-launched the iconic athletic brand Pony in 180 countries. “They have a simpler way of looking at things, of wiping away the marketing drivel that people tend to be caught up in. They have a way of getting past that to thinking in big breathtaking ways about products” Jeff Goodby / CR Creative Review (November 2002).
<br/><br/>
The American magazine New York wrote about them (21 July 2003): “Their work for Pepsi and Xbox in Europe made them the ad-world’s Spike Jonze”.

							<div data-effect="fadeup" class="timeline_year s_timeline_year" style="margin-top: 0px; opacity: 1;"><span class="" data-effect="number-rock">2005</span></div>

							<p>In 2005, Publicis Group chairman Maurice Levy personally hired “the already legendary advertising duo” (Paris Match, 18 July 2005) to launch Marcel, a new international digital agency based in Paris, named after the founder of Publicis’ group, Bleustein-Blanchet. Then Fred & Farid won 17 new accounts in just 18 months, including what French business newspaper Les Echos called “the pitch of the decade” for Internet/mobile Company Orange, leading the image of this European leader in 27 countries.</p>

							<div data-effect="fadeup" class="timeline_year s_timeline_year" style="margin-top: 0px; opacity: 1;"><span class="" data-effect="number-rock">2006</span></div>

							<p>At that stage, the team was world-renowned, British newspaper Independent wrote (16 October 2006): “If you’re interested in advertising creativity then you’ll be familiar with Fred & Farid (…) Fred & Farid have a formidable international reputation”.
							<br /><br />
In 2007, a new big chapter started, when French financial tycoon Vincent Bolloré offered to finance their own group, Fred & Farid Group. “Fred & Farid are so talented that it was a too good opportunity to pass up” Vincent Bolloré / Campaign (13 Oct 2006).</p>

<div data-effect="fadeup" class="timeline_year s_timeline_year" style="margin-top: 0px; opacity: 1;"><span class="" data-effect="number-rock">2007</span></div>

</p>

<div data-effect="fadeup" class="timeline_year s_timeline_year" style="margin-top: 0px; opacity: 1;"><span class="" data-effect="number-rock">2011</span></div>

<p>
	Fred & Farid's clients’ reactions were unanimously enthusiastic about the big opening of their very own new building in Paris in 2011:
<br /><br />
"They have a real talent, the ability to capture the spirit of the times through emotions" Hugues Pietrini (CEO France Orangina-Schweppes Group).
<br /><br />
"There is one word that springs to my mind: Pride. I am proud to have chosen you as our agency when you were still small“ Jean-Paul Torris (Vice President Bongrain SA).
<br /><br />
"They have created the campaign we've been dreaming of, it was a great pleasure to work with them and it still is" Caroline Guillaumin (Communication Director, Société Générale).
<br /><br />
"We were looking for an agency that would revive our brand. (...) They've been through amazing milestones with us in terms of rejuvenating our brand. They've helped us to take our brand from a dusty, old fashion brand, quite frankly a brand that people weren't looking at or talking about, to a brand that's alive and connecting with people." Adam Kakembo (Marketing Director EMEA Wrangler).
<br /><br /> 
"It's been 5 years that we've been working together, with a level of listening that I had rarely seen before in advertising agencies (...) I have discovered sensitive, passionate, good men, amused men, people on which one can count" Steeve Hagege (International General Brand Manager, Diesel Parfums, L’Oréal).
<br /><br />
Overall, in their career, Fred & Farid have worked for over 200 brands, and have won more than 340 international creative and marketing effectiveness awards in the most prestigious international festivals: Cannes Lions Festival, D&AD, Clio, One Show, FWA, Lovie Awards, Webby Awards, London International Awards, British TV Awards, Andy's, New York Festival, Eurobest, Creative Circle, Epica – including more than 50 digital awards since 2011.

<br /><br />
In 2009, Fred & Farid won the highly desired Cannes Lions Grand Prix for their iconic American brand Wrangler, a crowning achievement for every creative in the advertising industry. “Before, the brand was about middle-aged cowboy jeans from America. Now it takes a whole look overnight” David Lubars, President of Cannes Lions Festival.
<br /><br /> 
“They could have played in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino’s cult feature. They have won more than 200 international awards (…) Their agency Fred & Farid Group, launched only three years ago, has devastated the advertising planet“ Hedwige Chevrillon / BFM La Saga du Pouvoir (20 July 2010).
<br /><br />
"Firstly, they are Maverick rebels i.e. they are to communicate what Daniel Cohn Bendit is to politics, Andy Warhol to painting and Woody Allen to literature; they are always against the flow to be better in the flow. Then they precisely have this dual force, they use swimmingly this kind of essential block of two completely opposite but converging talents, and thirdly they are the relief team" Jacques Seguela / BFM La Saga du Pouvoir (20 July 2010).
<br /><br />
In 2012, Fred & Farid Group decided to develop outside Europe and chose to go East. They opened a new digital agency in a 1000m² warehouse in Shanghai. This new agency is 100% social media orientated. In just one year, their Chinese office has worked for 27 brands in China, including Porsche, Coca-Cola, Shang Xia, Sunning, Sogou, Avène… and renowned groups like L’Oréal and Pernod Ricard.

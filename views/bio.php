                    After studying respectively design and political science (Sciences Po), Fred Raillard and Farid Mokart started as strategic planner and account manager in Paris. They decided to team up and moved to the creative side, working consecutively for 6 major agencies in Paris. They were the two youngest creative directors in France, leading the international accounts of CLM/BBDO Paris. Their first digital hit was for start-up Aucland.com, the French eBay, inviting TV viewers to discover the end of the spot on the Internet. They soon became worldwide creative directors of Pepsi International (ROW). In 2000, Fred & Farid created the highly viral and controversial musical video of British Pop Star Robbie Williams “Rock DJ” which won the Brit Awards, and an MTV award in the USA.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Shots Magazine (Shots 61) chose the French team to start their gallery of the 12 best creative teams in the world (November 2000).
                    <br/><br/>
                    Then they embarked on an international career. At that time, Fred & Farid were the first major French creative team to move abroad and work outside France. In 2001, advertising legend Sir John Hegarty hired them at the prestigious BBH London to lead the biggest Microsoft launch: XBOX (500 million dollars).

                    The French business magazine Strategies nicknamed them “The two Zidanes of the French advertising creation” Strategies (27 September 2002).
                    <br/><br/>

                    <br/><br/>
                    In 2002, the American advertising star Jeff Goodby hired them at digital agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco where they launched Netflix in USA and UK, and re-launched the iconic athletic brand Pony in 180 countries. “They have a simpler way of looking at things, of wiping away the marketing drivel that people tend to be caught up in. They have a way of getting past that to thinking in big breathtaking ways about products” Jeff Goodby / CR Creative Review (November 2002).
                    <br/><br/>
                    The American magazine New York wrote about them (21 July 2003): “Their work for Pepsi and Xbox in Europe made them the ad-world’s Spike Jonze”.

                    "They have created the campaign we've been dreaming of, it was a great pleasure to work with them and it still is" Caroline Guillaumin (Communication Director, Société Générale).
                    <br /><br />
                    "We were looking for an agency that would revive our brand. (...) They've been through amazing milestones with us in terms of rejuvenating our brand. They've helped us to take our brand from a dusty, old fashion brand, quite frankly a brand that people weren't looking at or talking about, to a brand that's alive and connecting with people." Adam Kakembo (Marketing Director EMEA Wrangler).
                    <br /><br /> 
                    "It's been 5 years that we've been working together, with a level of listening that I had rarely seen before in advertising agencies (...) I have discovered sensitive, passionate, good men, amused men, people on which one can count" Steeve Hagege (International General Brand Manager, Diesel Parfums, L’Oréal).

                    <br /><br /> 
                    “They could have played in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino’s cult feature. They have won more than 200 international awards (…) Their agency Fred & Farid Group, launched only three years ago, has devastated the advertising planet“ Hedwige Chevrillon / BFM La Saga du Pouvoir (20 July 2010).
                    <br /><br />
                    "Firstly, they are Maverick rebels i.e. they are to communicate what Daniel Cohn Bendit is to politics, Andy Warhol to painting and Woody Allen to literature; they are always against the flow to be better in the flow. Then they precisely have this dual force, they use swimmingly this kind of essential block of two completely opposite but converging talents, and thirdly they are the relief team" Jacques Seguela / BFM La Saga du Pouvoir (20 July 2010).
                    <br /><br />
                    In 2012, Fred & Farid Group decided to develop outside Europe and chose to go East. They opened a new digital agency in a 1000m² warehouse in Shanghai.
